# Bird-Detector
An app that helps you to find the scientific name of the bird and provides you with some bird information. 
The basic purpose of this app is for bird lovers or those who have an interest in knowing more about the birds. 
You can load images from the gallery as well as take pictures of the bird and can load them into the app
The detection of birds is made through an ML model called the Bird Model.
The dependency which I have used to support the ml model is the TensorFlow Lite dependency
